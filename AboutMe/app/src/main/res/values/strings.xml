    <string name="bio">Managing risk comes from the enterprise’s need to share information and protect resources from unauthorized use.
        \n\nProtecting information from unauthorized is only one of the concerns, however.
        \n\nPhysical forms such as fires, floods, and earthquakes should be taken into consideration as well.
        \n\nIncluding security and privacy in an EA program helps to mitigate these risks in all areas of the enterprise.
        \n\nThe physical security that should be reflected in the Security and Privacy plan are controls for the facilities that support IT processing,
        \n\ncontrol of access to buildings, equipment, networks, telecommunication rooms, fire protection, media storage, and disaster recovery systems.
        \n\nThere are a number of strategies in enforcing this security.
        \n\nFor instance, building security may require a physical wall surround the building’s area.
        \n\nThe requirements of physical security will be different between organizations.</string>
